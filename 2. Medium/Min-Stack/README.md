# 155. Min Stack

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MEDIUM-orange)

## Description

Design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and retrieving the minimum element in `constant time`.

Implement the MinStack class:

`MinStack()` initializes the stack object. \
`void push(int val)` pushes the element val onto the stack. \
`void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack. \
`int top()` gets the top element of the stack. \
`int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack. \
You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.
